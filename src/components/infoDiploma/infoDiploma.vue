            This is the curses that I've taken. 
            They taught me a lot and with the help of the curse staff I was able to ask questions and get answers.  
            Of course they only covered their subjects so mostly I was self learning from the internet as well. 
            The curses gave me the basics of some thechnologis but all the issues and bugs that was coming along the way, I needed to solve on my own.
