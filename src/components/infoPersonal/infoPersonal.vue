        <p class="text text__content"> 
            I am passionate web developer I like to design and build websites. 
            One of the most fun parts for me is to organize my CSS/SCSS folders and to break a part my html to a lot of reusable components. 
            I strive for aesthetic design and implementation with cutting edge technology, and the internet is my best teacher for that. 
            I enjoy challenging  myself to learning something new that will enrich my knowledge.

            I have other hobbies as well, one of them is aquascaping i have 2 beautiful aquariums that gives the best soul charger push in the morning. 
            I am also a fan of board games and have small collection at home, furthermore I like old movies and tv series so spoiler alert.
            And the last one I practice watercoloring by painting small paintings.
